# InteractiveClimateModel
Project for Hack the Burgh 19.

See the effects of climate change on your area! This interactive map takes climate projections up to 2100 and displays them for you up to the year 2100. Choose the year and the level of projected emissions (low, medium or high) to see the projections rendered interactively on the map. Currently supports projected sea-levels and temperatures. Further climate variables might be forthcoming.

First run the backend server with "python server.py". If the server does not run on localhost you will need to change the paths in the frontend map2.html file.

Then just load the frontend html file map2.html. If all goes well it should load and the map should render.
